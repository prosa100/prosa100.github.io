Extended CefSharp.OffScreen.ChromiumWebBrowser to  override InvokeRenderAsync and upload the bitmap to the gpu insted of copying it around.
I wounder how many times this data is copied.
BackBufferHandle

OpenTK seems to still to be the best OpenGL BINDING
I may want an engine... (Maybe use mongame or someti)

24 ms 'dumb' lag time.
4 ms with 'fast' mode
http does not acutlly have that much overhead.
i need to transfer 80kb.
I could transfer to a format that can be loaded directly to the gpu, but for android, this is a mess.
I will just use png for now, unless lag.

Selenium WebDriver sounds cool.

ETC1 is 170kb for same image...
