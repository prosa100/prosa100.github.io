# Methods to connect
Get the video off the device.

## Wifi
Suports file transfer and streaming, wireless.
Possible interfearence.
Streaming is useful becuse the goal is to have 8-hour recordings. Possible reduced video quality. 
Micro SD are not viable becuse of the length.

It is an wifi n acess point and a web server. Can download from the dcim directory.
Can stream from live. Use FFMJPEG to convert the video.
Possible to convert?

## HDMI
An alternitive way. Limited to 1080p 60fps (which is plenty), but requires capture cards (~$60 each)
Bulky and not that great.
Timing will always be within 2 frames.

## Magic SD Card
Their is a WIFI full-sized card, but that is too big.
I could hook it up to an FPGA or a micro controler, but I am not an EE and this way is time consuming.

# Stich it up.

I am going to use my libary to do this in realtime for vr when I am done.
