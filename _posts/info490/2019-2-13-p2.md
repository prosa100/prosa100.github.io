First, I drew a random bat dog thing using a tablet.

Then I traced it in the sotfware and cut it out 4 times with 4 diffrent color mats.

I pealed them off carefuly, but made mental note to cut all the way through next time to make it easier to assemble.

When assembled it ended up looking like this.

I also assembled another color swap from the scraps.

If I where to do this again, it is important what order I assemble the stickers. Put the bigest piece first like I did the first time.
Also design it so it has larger features.

I had fun sketching the batdog.
