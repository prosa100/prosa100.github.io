For Model #1 I started with some 3d scans of cultural significanges obtained from http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/

I usesed an anthromorphic armadillo, and a scan of a 3d dragon becuse I like antromorphic animals.

First, I removed the armadillo's head.
Then, I added the tail and the head of the dragon to the armadillo.
Finally, Then I used brushs to fix the seams, blend, and add details.

For Backup #2, I started with a 3d scan of a fox skull and a statue.

Then I remeshed it.
Then I subtracted a crude version of my head from it.
Then I reduced the poly count.
Then I did an edge transfrom to get that cool style
Then I morphed it back the the origanal shape.

That's how I got the lowpoly fox support I wanted.
This is becuse I like making costumes.
