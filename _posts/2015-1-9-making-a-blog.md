title : Making a blog.
layout : post

I decided to host my blog on github becuse I like the idea of jekyll.
I use a template from here https://github.com/gdg-managua/jekyll-mdl
I would like to add it like a submodule becuse it is under active development.
This is not that simple becuse git submodules require you to not be root.
The obvious solution is to use a symlink, but that does not work becuse I am using windows.
I do not want to fork their repo becuse it's a template and I may change it at some point.
For now, I will just install it manually.
