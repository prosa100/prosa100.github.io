mouth-to-ear delay -> 200 ms
Because of the Haas effect an additional 15 milliseconds can be added to the delay time of the loudspeakers nearer the audience, so that the stage's wavefront reaches them first, to focus the audience's attention on the stage rather than the local loudspeaker. The slightly later sound from delayed loudspeakers simply increases the perceived sound level without negatively affecting localization.

Unity vs Unreal
I am unhapy with unity right now becuse they are still on 2.0 an the api is a mess.
Seems to be more limited.

Unreal offers grants. Sketchup importer?
Useful multi-importer https://github.com/assimp/assimp




Node-based. Unity does not. Proably are working on.
Unreal is more for building games. Has a lot of stuff built. Would be traped.

what will unity do about this?

All of the engines are flexible.
I know unity.
